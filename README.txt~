DNA Localised Circuit Compiler - DLCC v1.0

################
# Installation #
################
Requires:
- Python > 2.7
- matplotlib (http://matplotlib.org/)
- networkx (https://networkx.github.io/)
- pyparsing (https://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/)
- Prism (http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/)


################
#   Running    #
################
Run from the command line like this:   python dlcc.py tests/test1.dlin
Input files are given the .dlin extension.
Output files will be saved to a timestamped directory in the "out" folder.


################
#   Precision  #
################
Track lengths (in anchorages) are given an upper bound of 20 (the number that you can fit on an origami tile).
If a track longer than 20 is required to meet the MCE tolerance, DLCC will give a precision error.
  

################
#Tests/Examples#
################
Sample input files are provided in the "tests" folder.

- test1.dlin
  Description: Compound propositional formula that can be readily solved with a low MCE tolerance (P(error) = 0.10).  

- test2.dlin
  Description: Example of topological refinement.  DLCC detects and eliminates a double negative to make a simpler but equivalent circuit.

- test3.dlin
  Description: Example of a problem that is difficult for a localised circuit to solve.  Even with a MCE tolerance of P(error) = 0.5, we still get very long tracks.

- test4.dlin
  Description: Very simple test/debugging case of Â¬x.


################
#   Graphics   #
################
Can be buggy and sometimes you get tracks that overlap.  Since the simple representation is just to give the scale of the lengths, and not really how the track would be organised on an origami tile, we didn't put much time into the visualisation.


################
#In Development#
################
We're still working on a few features like:
- fanout
- a walker that can block a track and keep on walking, potentially blocking other tracks thereafter
